# 🎉 **NAVIGATION FIXED - ALL PAGES WORKING!**

## ✅ **PROBLEM SOLVED: NAVIGATION NOW WORKS**

I have successfully fixed the navigation issue! When you click on any navigation item (Dashboard, Projects, Invoices, Expenses), you will now be navigated to the actual page instead of staying on the dashboard.
